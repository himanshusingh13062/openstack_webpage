        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project focuses on deploying and hosting a website using OpenStack and NGINX, demonstrating the capabilities of cloud infrastructure and web server management. OpenStack, an open-source platform for managing cloud environments, allows for scalable and flexible deployment, while NGINX acts as a high-performance web server. By leveraging OpenStack's computing power, the project establishes a reliable, self-hosted solution that includes creating instances, configuring NGINX for web content delivery, and optimizing resources for secure hosting. This setup showcases how cloud solutions can effectively power modern, scalable websites for various applications.
